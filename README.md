# Encrypted Chat Application

This project is an encrypted chat application built using Java Swing with Vigenère cipher between client and server.

## Features

- The program allows users to securely communicate with each other using Vigenère cipher encryption.
- The program has a graphical user interface built using Java Swing.
- The program has both a client and server component to enable communication between two or more users.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Compile and run the Server.java file to start the server:

4. The client GUI will appear on your screen. Enter your username and the IP address of the server to connect to.
5. Once connected, you can securely communicate with other users using Vigenère cipher encryption.

## Vigenère Cipher

The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to encrypt and decrypt messages. In this chat application, the Vigenère cipher is used to securely transmit messages between users.

##Future Improvements

1. Add support for multiple clients to connect to the server simultaneously.
2. Implement stronger encryption algorithms for more secure communication.
3. Improve the GUI to make it more user-friendly.
